/**
 * Tab-separated field encoding for every record this plugin stores and every row it sends

 *
 * <p>The same choice, for the same reasons, as the other extensions in this repository:
 * XStream renders an immutable list as an undecodable {@code CollSer} blob and a list of
 * maps in a shape the console's decoder cannot reliably unpick, so a flat list of strings
 * is the only structure that survives the round trip. Control characters are stripped
 * rather than escaped, because one stray tab inside a value would shift every later field
 * of the record by one -- silently, and permanently once the record is read back in its
 * corrupted form.
